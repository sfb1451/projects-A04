description	LH_LepRNts_spontaneous-locomotion is a dataset of single-cell calcium imaging transients of LepR+ or Nts+ cells in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) of male mice during sponteous exploration of a free feeding enclosure during sated, acutely hungry, and chronically hungry state, to be used to compare state-dependent stimulus response profiles during sponanteous locomotion of both cell populations. Data were collected by Dr. Anne Petzold in the lab of Prof. Tatiana Korotkova.
